# solarsystem

Welcome, this is a scale model of our solar system (approximately 100000:1 ).

The size of the planets and sun are to scale as are the average distances between each other to scale. 

You will also notice that in the outer planets there is some jittering, this is due to floating point precision errors due to the shear size of the solar system. Ultimately this requires a significant rework of the project to get it to behave correctly and is something that will be addressed in future releases.

Switch between inner and outer solar system views by clicking on the top left button, click on planets to view them, and press escape to return to the solar system view.

The project is far from perfect and requires several modifications to make is architecturally sound, however as one realizes with experience, is that no piece of code is perfect and if I were to chase that goal, I would never have a demonstrable piece of work.

Enjoy! ChaosPixy.
