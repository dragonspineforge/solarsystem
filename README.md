# solarsystem

Welcome, this is a scale model of our solar system (aproximatley 100000:1 ).

The size of the planets and sun are to scale as are the average distances between each other to scale. 

As yet I still need to set the orbital velocities and rotational velocities to scale.

You will also notice that in the outer planets there is some jittering, this is due to flaoting point porecision errors due to the shear sixe of the solar system. Ultimatley this requires a significant rewolk of the project to get it to behave correclty and is something that will be addressed in future releases.

Switch between inner and outer solar system views by clicking on the top left button, click on planets to view them, and press escape to return to the solar system view.

The project is far from perfect and requires some serveral modifictions to make is arcitectually sound, however as one relizes with experience, is that no piece of code is perfect and if I were to chase that goal, I would never have a demonstratable piece of work.


Enjoy! ChaosPixy.
